# Basic
- D3 employs a declarative approach, operating on arbitrary sets of nodes called - selections

    ```js
    d3.selectAll("p").style("color", "white")
    d3.select("body").style("background-color", "black")
    ```
  - Modifying documents using the W3C DOM API is tedious: the method names are verbose, and the imperative approach requires manual iteration and bookkeeping of temporary state

    ```js
    var paragraphs = document.getElementsByTagName("p");
    for (var i = 0; i < paragraphs.length; i++) {
        var paragraph = paragraphs.item(i);
        paragraph.style.setProperty("color", "white", null);
    }
    ```

- Direct access to the underlying DOM is also possible, as each D3 selection is simply an array of nodes
- Styles, attributes, and other properties can be specified as functions of data in D3, not just simple constants
  - D3 provides many built-in reusable functions and function factories, such as graphical primitives for area, line and pie charts
    - Computed properties often refer to bound data. Data is specified as an array of values, and each value is passed as the first argument (`d`) to selection functions. With the default join-by-index, the first element in the data array is passed to the first node in the selection, the second element to the second node, and so on

    ```js
    d3.selectAll("p")
        .data([4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42])
            .style("font-size", function(d) { return d + "px"; })
    ```

    - Once the data has been bound to the document, you can omit the data operator; D3 will retrieve the previously-bound data. This allows you to recompute properties without rebinding
## Enter and Exit
- Create new nodes for incoming data and remove outgoing nodes that are no longer needed
- When data is bound to a selection, each element in the data array is paired with the corresponding node in the selection. If there are fewer nodes than data, the extra data elements form the enter selection, which you can instantiate by appending to the enter selection

    ```js
    // Update…
    var p = d3.select("body")
        .selectAll("p")
        .data([4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42])
            .text(function(d) { return d; })

    // Enter…
    p.enter().append("p")
        .text(function(d) { return d; })

    // Exit…
    p.exit().remove()
    ```

## Transitions
- Transitions gradually interpolate styles and attributes over time
- Tweening can be controlled via easing functions such as “elastic”, “cubic-in-out” and “linear”
- D3’s interpolators support both primitives, such as numbers and numbers embedded within strings (font sizes, path data, etc.), and compound values. You can even extend D3’s interpolator registry to support complex properties and data structures
# D3-force
- Steps
  1. Create a simulation for an array of nodes
  2. Compose the desired forces
  3. Listen for tick events to render the nodes as they update in the graphics system, such as Canvas or SVG

- To remove the force with the given name, pass null as the force
- A force is simply a **function** that modifies nodes’ **positions** or **velocities**
  - In this context, a force can apply a classical physical force such as electrical charge or gravity, or it can resolve a geometric constraint, such as keeping nodes within a bounding box or keeping linked nodes a fixed distance apart
    - Forces typically read the node’s current position ⟨x,y⟩ and then add to (or subtract from) the node’s velocity ⟨vx,vy⟩
      - Forces may also “peek ahead” to the anticipated next position of the node, ⟨x + vx,y + vy⟩; this is necessary for resolving geometric constraints through iterative relaxation
    - Forces may also modify the position directly, which is sometimes useful to avoid adding energy to the simulation, such as when recentering the simulation in the viewport
- Centering
  - This force helps keeps nodes in the center of the viewport, and unlike the positioning force, it does not distort their relative positions
- Collision
  - The collision force treats nodes as circles with a given **radius**, rather than points, and prevents nodes from **overlapping**
- Links
  - The link force pushes linked nodes together or apart according to the desired link distance
  - The strength of the force is proportional to the **difference** between the linked nodes’ distance and the target distance, similar to a spring force
- Many-body
  - The many-body (or n-body) force applies mutually amongst **all nodes**
  - It can be used to simulate gravity (attraction) if the strength is positive, or electrostatic charge (repulsion) if the strength is negative
  - A positive value causes nodes to attract each other, similar to gravity, while a negative value causes nodes to repel each other, similar to electrostatic charge
  - Unlike links, which only affect two linked nodes, the charge force is global: every node affects every other node, even if they are on disconnected subgraphs
- `simulation.nodes([nodes])`
  - If nodes is specified, sets the simulation’s nodes to the specified array of objects, initializing their positions and velocities if necessary, and then **re-initializes** any bound forces; returns the simulation
  - If nodes is not specified, returns the simulation’s array of nodes as specified to the constructor
  - The following properties are assigned by the simulation
    1. `index` - the node’s zero-based index into nodes
    2. `x` - the node’s current x-position
    3. `y` - the node’s current y-position
    4. `vx` - the node’s current x-velocity
    5. `vy` - the node’s current y-velocity
  - To fix a node in a given position, you may specify two additional properties:
    1. `fx` - the node’s fixed x-position
    2. `fy` - the node’s fixed y-position
  - If the specified array of nodes is modified, such as when nodes are added to or removed from the simulation, this method must be **called again** with the new (or changed) array to notify the simulation and bound forces of the change; the simulation does not make a defensive copy of the specified array
- `simulation.force(name, [, force])`
  - If force is specified, assigns the force for the specified name and returns this simulation
  - If force is not specified, returns the force with the specified name, or undefined if there is no such force
  - By default, new simulations have no forces

    ```js
    // create a new simulation to **layout** a graph
    var simulation = d3.forceSimulation(nodes)
        .force("charge", d3.forceManyBody())
        .force("link", d3.forceLink(links))
        .force("center", d3.forceCenter())
    ```
- `simulation.on(typenames [,listener])`
  - If listener is specified, sets the event listener for the specified typenames and returns this simulation
  - If an event listener was already registered for the same type and name, the existing listener is removed before the new listener is added
  - If listener is null, removes the current event listeners for the specified typenames, if any
  - If listener is not specified, returns the first currently-assigned listener matching the specified typenames, if any
  - When a specified event is dispatched, each listener will be invoked with the `this` context as the simulation
  - The `typenames` is a string containing **one or more typename separated by whitespace**
    - Each typename is a type, optionally followed by a period (`.`) and a name, such as `tick.foo` and `tick.bar`
    - The name allows multiple listeners to be registered for the same type
    - The type must be one of the following:
        1. `tick` - after each tick of the simulation’s internal timer.
        1. `end` - after the simulation’s timer stops when alpha < alphaMin
    - `tick` events are not dispatched when `simulation.tick` is called manually
    - Events are only dispatched by the internal timer and are intended for interactive rendering of the simulation
    - To affect the simulation, **register forces** instead of modifying nodes’ positions or velocities inside a tick event listener
